I logged into my ieng6 using the ssh command, and the code rsaraf@ieng6.ucsd.edu

I used the SSH URL on my GitHub account to clone the repository's fork. Command used: https://github.com/rudii004/lab7.git

*I pushed the < down > key 43 times to reach the error line, then the < right > key about 12 times to reach index 1's number 1, which I subsequently changed to 2. 
Keys pressed: < esc > wq < enter > I use the < esc > key to enter command mode, then the wq key to write and quit vim, then the < enter > key to basically save the file's modifications and exit.*

## *Re-running tests*

I used the bash test.sh command to execute the test cases again to make sure all the tests passed. Keys pressed: bash test.sh

## *commit and push*

I reinitialized the repository by using the git init command first, then I added the updated file to the repository by using the git add ListExamples.java command and pressing enter. Subsequently, I utilised the git commit -m programme and hit enter to commit the modifications together with a note indicating “Fixed testMerge2”. Finally, I pushed the modifications to the main branch by using the git push origin main command and pressing enter. Hit the following keys: git init git add ListExamples.java commit space on git Enter -m space "Fixed testMerge2" and then git, push, origin and main.
