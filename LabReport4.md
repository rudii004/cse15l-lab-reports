I logged into my ieng6 using the ssh command, and the code rsaraf@ieng6.ucsd.edu

## *Clone forked repository*

I used the SSH URL on my GitHub account to clone the repository's fork. Command used: https://github.com/rudii004/lab7.git

I compiled and ran the tests with javac and java respectively. The tests failed as they ran. 

## *Using vim for editing the code*

As we can see the, the first image is the original file of ListExamples.java, and the second image is the modified version which I did using vim. 
Keys pressed: "down" for 43 times to get to the line index1+=1 and then "right" about 12 times to get to the 1, so that I can change it to 2. Passed keys: esc wq enter I enter command mode by using the esc key, which is followed by the wq comand, which writes and ends vim, and the enter key, which essentially saves the charges made to the file and exits. 

## *Re-running tests*

I used the bash test.sh command to execute the test cases again to make sure all the tests passed. Keys pressed: bash test.sh

## *commit and push*
