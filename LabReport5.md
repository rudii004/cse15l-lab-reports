# Lab report 5 ( Putting it all together )

## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

In order to create a new array with every element from the original array, I need to develop a procedure that accepts an array as input. Instead, my code prints each element from the second array and skips the first one, publishing the elements from the second array first. My for loop might be having problems, I think.This is a screenshot of the code.

## response of the TA:

Hey! It sounds like there might be an issue with how your loop is iterating over the arrays. Can you share the exact code or at least the section with the for loop? Additionally, check if you are properly initializing your new array before starting the loop.

## Response of the Student after changes:

Thank you for the suggestions. Upon inspection, I found out that the code was adding 1 to the correct mean; so, I made the changes needed to achieve the correct mean.


## The files and the directory structures:



## The Correct Code:



## Description of the edit code :

I fixed the code by removing the +1 and changing the part where 1 was added to the array length. 


## Part 2( Reflection)

In the latter portion of this quarter, I became well-versed in the vim command's editing capabilities. Using this command, I learned how to modify my code in a number of ways and what keys I might press to get different results.
