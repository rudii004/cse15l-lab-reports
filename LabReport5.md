# Lab report 5 ( Putting it all together )

## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

In order to create a new array with every element from the original array, I need to develop a procedure that accepts an array as input. Instead, my code prints each element from the second array and skips the first one, publishing the elements from the second array first. My for loop might be having problems, I think.This is a screenshot of the code.

## response of the TA:

Hey! It sounds like there might be an issue with how your loop is iterating over the arrays. Can you share the exact code or at least the section with the for loop? Additionally, check if you are properly initializing your new array before starting the loop.

## Response of the Student after changes:

Thank you for the suggestions. Upon inspection, I found out that the code was adding 1 to the correct mean; so, I made the changes needed to achieve the correct mean.


## The files and the directory structures:

## Description of the edit code :

I fixed the code by removing the +1 and changing the part where 1 was added to the array length. 


## Part 2( Reflection)

I spent the latter part of this quarter learning how to use the editing features of the vim command. With the help of this command, I was able to change my code in a variety of ways and discovered which keys would produce different outcomes.
